STRIPE SETUP
================================================================================================================================

If you also want to activate the Stripe payment gateway, you need to follow the steps below:


1. In your Stripe account, create your products. This can be done at https://dashboard.stripe.com/products. 
   These products will coincide with ONLY your MONTHLY subscription packages you create in the admin panel. Products are NOT needed for your 
   add-on/1-time credit packages as they are only required for subscription(recurring) payments.

   So if you create 5 monthly subscription credit packages in the script, you will need to create 5 products in your Stripe account. 
   Just match up the name and amount fields.

   IMPORTANT: After creating your product, you will see a "Pricing" section for that product. Copy the field value under the "API ID" column. It will start 
   with "price_". This is the actual value you will need to copy/paste in the "Plan ID" field in the admin panel monthly packages of the script.


2. If you create MONTHLY subscription packages in the admin, then you need to set a notification URL in Stripe. 
   In Stripe, go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks

   * Click on the "Add endpoint" button and enter "http://YOURSITEURL/users/getnotification" -- where YOURSITEURL is the exact location of where 
     you have the script installed at.

   * Click the "Select types to send" radio button and check the boxes for these 5 events:
     
     1.customer.subscription.created
     2.customer.subscription.deleted
     3.customer.subscription.updated
     4.invoice.payment_succeeded
     5.invoice.payment_failed

   * Click the Add endpoint button.


3. Whilst logged into your scripts administrative panel, click on 'Config', then click on 'Stripe Config', and 'Edit'. 
   
   * Enter your Stripe Live Secret Key and Live Publishable Key
     (You API keys can be obtained by going to account settings at https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys)

   * Save changes


IMPORTANT: Stripe requires SSL be installed on your domain. Using Stripe, sensitive credit card information is sent directly 
to Stripe, and does NOT touch your server. However, in order to protect yourself from certain forms of man-in-the-middle attacks, 
you must serve the page containing the payment form over HTTPS as well. 

Additionally, your customers are more comfortable sharing sensitive information on pages visibly served over HTTPS, which can help 
increase your customer conversion rate.

See here for more info: https://stripe.com/docs/security



FORCE SSL Redirection
====================================================================================================================================

Once you have SSL installed on your server and you can access your site through https://, you may want to force the site to always
use https:// and not http://. 

1. Open your .htaccess file in the root folder of your install.
2. Uncomment(remove the # sign) next to "RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off"
3. Uncomment(remove the # sign) next to "RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]"
4. Save changes
